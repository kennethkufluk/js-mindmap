A demo is provided at:

Requires jQuery for basic shortcuts ($) and stuff.
Requires Raphael for drawing.
jQuery UI may be used to allow draggable nodes.

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

This is a small demo script, intended for fun applications.
My favourite is this:

If you feel like building it out into a massively overfeatured application, please go ahead.  While I've stuck some liberal licensing on it, the basic principles of a force directed layout controlling nodes are as free as the birds in the trees.
My favourite massively overfeatured application is this:

HOW THIS WORKS
--------------

It's relatively easy to build a mindmap.  Take a collection of HTML nodes, and position them absolutely.  Use a Force Directed Layout to link them together and yet keep them apart.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-based_algorithms_(graph_drawing)

Once you've got that, you need to add some filters, to define which nodes are properly connected. All nodes should repel, to prevent overlap, but connected nodes should have a string between them.  This is where you use a springy force (hooke's law) to pull them together.

Drawing lines in HTML is not an easy feat.  IE has/had VML, all browsers (except Android) support SVG (albeit slowly), and all except IE support Canvas.  I tried using a diagonal line in a JPG, stretching it to fit.  It looks daft.  I then switched to Canvas, and now I'm on SVG (using Raphael to support IE VML too).  So it works everywhere except Android.


ALTERNATIVES
------------

Before I wrote this, I used an open-source mindmap written in Flex.  It was beautiful.
It's here:
http://www.rubenswieringa.com/blog/interactive-mindmap
It uses Mark Shepard's SpringGraph component, which has lots of interesting demos:

I considered migrating this component to JS, but found it massively over-complicated for the simple uses I had in mind.


APPLICATIONS IN THE WILD
------------------------

I use this code for my own mindmap website here:

Also, there's a PCWorld page about Google here:

Let me know of any others to add here.
